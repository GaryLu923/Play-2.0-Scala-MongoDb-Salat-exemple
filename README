There is a tutorial about how to create a todo
application using Play 2.0 framework with Scala.

Here it is http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/ScalaTodoList 

But it uses Anorm Sql database.

I tried to find a way to use a NoSql MongoDB database in this example and 
finished up using Salat extention.

How to use:

Complete the tutorial mentioned before if you didn't already do that.

Replace project/Build.scala file by the one from this repo.

Do "play dependencies".

Replace other files in application by files from this repo.

Don't forget to start mongodb daemon! It should use default host (localhost) and default port.

Run the application, if everything works, congratulations, you've done it!

Have fun!
